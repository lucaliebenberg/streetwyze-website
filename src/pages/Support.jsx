          Having successfully completed Phase 1 of our application, a
          significant milestone in the StreetWyze app development, we are now
          poised to enter Phase 2. However, to propel our project further, we
          find ourselves in need of additional capital. The costs of development
          are pressing, requiring a substantial influx of funds to fully realize
          the potential of the StreetWyze app as a premier Tourism Safety
          Application in the market.

          support, whether through financial contributions or any other form of
          assistance, carries immense significance. Every contribution,
          regardless of its scale, is genuinely valued and deeply appreciated.
          The collective backing we have received thus far emboldens our pursuit
          of excellence and fuels our determination.

          We extend our sincere gratitude to those who have already shown their

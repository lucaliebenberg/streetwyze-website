        Having successfully completed Phase 1 of our application, a significant
        milestone in the StreetWyze app development, we are now poised to enter
        Phase 2. However, to propel our project further, we find ourselves in
        need of additional capital. The costs of development are pressing,
        requiring a substantial influx of funds to fully realize the potential
        of the StreetWyze app as a premier Tourism Safety Application in the
        market.
